# Pizza-Sales-Analytics-and-Dashboard-Design

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data to extract actionable business insights. By calculating key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizing them through an interactive dashboard, the project provides stakeholders with a clear understanding of sales trends, peak periods, and underperforming products. The project demonstrates end-to-end data handling, from data extraction and cleaning to advanced querying and visualization.

## Objective
To analyze pizza sales data, identify key metrics such as total revenue, average order value, and total pizzas sold, and develop a comprehensive dashboard that offers insights into daily sales trends, top-performing products, and customer preferences.

## Approach

- **Data Import & Structuring**:  
  Imported raw pizza sales data into **MS SQL Server** and structured it into a normalized relational database for optimized query performance.
  
- **Data Cleaning**:  
  Utilized SQL to clean the dataset by correcting inconsistencies in pizza sizes (S = Small, M = Medium, L = Large) and other categorical variables.
  
- **KPI Calculation**:  
  Wrote SQL queries to calculate essential business metrics:
    - Total Revenue
    - Average Order Value
    - Total Pizzas Sold
    - Total Orders
    - Average Pizzas per Order
  
- **Advanced Data Manipulation**:  
  Used SQL to generate insights by analyzing pizza sales by category, size, and time period. Key queries were written to identify peak order times, popular pizza categories, and underperforming items.
  
- **Visualization**:  
  Exported the cleaned data to **Excel** and performed additional data processing using **Power Query**. Created a set of visualizations to showcase business KPIs using various charts (bar charts, funnel charts, pie charts). The final dashboard was designed to be intuitive and aesthetically pleasing, providing stakeholders with valuable insights for decision-making.
  
- **Verification**:  
  Ensured data integrity by cross-verifying the outputs at each step of the dashboard creation process with the original SQL query results, ensuring the data was accurate and consistent.
